# Pedomoter-
This pedometer was made using the guide created by Dessy Daskalov. You can reference it here: [Pedometer in the real world](https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-pedometer-in-the-real-world.html)

Thank you to Dessy for creating the guide and going in depth to provide the theory behind the code.
